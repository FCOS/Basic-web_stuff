			<h2>Home</h2>
			<p>Drogheda Water Polo, is a club based in drogheda, and its surounding areas.
			We have a division topping senior team, aswell as a growing youth squad. The senior
			team was established in 1983, and the youth squad was started in 2008. Since then the
			now under 16 team has won the leinster league once, been runner up once, and reached
			the semi-finals of the all-irelands. The present under 14's have also just won the leinster 
			league, and reached a respectable quarter-final place earlier in the year.

			<p>So come on down to join us! We train at the aura pool in drogheda, between 7:00
			and 8:00, on a Monday evening, but please be poolside by around 6:30, so you can warm up. You must be a 
			strong swimmer, and be able to tread water, and we'll teach you the rest!
